***Crowdfunding Database Project***

This project involved extracting and transforming Excel data into CSV files to create a PostgreSQL database for crowdfunding data.

Data Cleaning and Transformation
The crowdfunding.xlsx Excel file contained raw data from a crowdfunding website. This data needed to be cleaned and transformed into four CSV files:

category.csv - Contains category ID and name columns. The category ID column contains values like "cat1", "cat2", etc.

subcategory.csv - Contains subcategory ID and name columns. The subcategory ID column contains values like "subcat1", "subcat2", etc.

contacts.csv - Contains contact ID, first name, last name, and email columns.

campaign.csv - Contains campaign data including ID, contact ID, description, goal amount, pledged amount, status, backer count, launch date, end date, country, currency, category ID, and subcategory ID.

The raw Excel data was loaded into Pandas DataFrames and cleaned using methods like .str.split(), .astype(),  and .to_datetime(). The cleaned DataFrames were exported into the four CSV files.

**Database Schema**

An ERD diagram was created using QuickDBD to plan out the database schema based on the relationships between the CSV files.

The ERD was used to create a Postgres database schema SQL file crowdfunding_db_schema.sql that contains CREATE TABLE statements for each of the four tables, along with primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

**Creating the Database**

The Postgres database crowdfunding_db was created and the tables were generated by running the SQL statements from the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file.

Finally, each of the four CSV files was imported into its corresponding database table.

The database is now ready to be queried and analyzed!
